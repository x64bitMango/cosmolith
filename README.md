## IF YOU ARE TRYING TO PUSH A NEW VERSION YOU MADE:

Make a branch, call it whatever you want, and just push to that branch. This main branch is going to be once we all review what's been made in each other's branches, combine the things, and merge them all to the main branch.

### new commits:
It'd be greatly appreciated if you commented what changes were made in the comments part of whenever you commit something new to the repo
